In Neo-Citania, eight million citizens live with neural Links that suppress "inefficient" emotions and modify inconvenient memories. Neural Compliance Specialist Mileo Chen has spent years optimizing other people's minds—until microscopic fractures in his own Link integration reveal the horrifying truth:

**The system isn't optimizing human consciousness. It's harvesting it.**

But as the Renaissance Protocol activates—a city-wide consciousness extraction operation—they have seven days to prevent eight million minds from being permanently harvested.
