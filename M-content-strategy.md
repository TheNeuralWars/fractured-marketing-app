**Engagement Tweets:**
Question for the resistance: If you could enhance your consciousness, but it meant giving up some control, would you do it? 

The Neural Wars trilogy explores this dilemma. What's your take?

#ConsciousnessDebate #NeuralWars

**Thread Series:**
ðŸ§µ Thread: Real neuroscience that inspired #FracturedCode (1/8)

Brain-computer interfaces are advancing rapidly. In 2023, researchers achieved [specific breakthrough]. But what are the ethical implications? 

This real tech inspired the Link system in #NeuralWars...

**Behind-the-Scenes:**
Fun fact: Kora's Cascade sensitivity was inspired by real studies on neural plasticity in extreme stress situations.

The resistance is built on real science + human resilience.

### LinkedIn Strategy (Author Profile)

**Posting Schedule:** 3 posts weekly
**Content Focus:** Professional insights, technology ethics, writing craft

**LinkedIn Post Types:**

**Technology Ethics:**
As AI advances, "Fractured Code" explores crucial questions: Who controls our mental enhancement? 

Current neural interface research shows promise for treating depression and paralysis. But safeguards are essential.

My sci-fi trilogy examines these real-world implications through human stories.

What ethical frameworks should guide neural enhancement?

**Writing Craft:**
Writing authentic sci-fi requires balancing scientific accuracy with human emotion.

For "Fractured Code," I researched:
â€¢ Current neural interface technology
â€¢ Consciousness studies
â€¢ Resistance movement psychology

The goal: Make the impossible feel inevitable.

Fellow writers: How do you research speculative elements?

**Industry Insights:**
The sci-fi publishing landscape is evolving. Readers want:
âœ“ Diverse perspectives
âœ“ Scientific accuracy  
âœ“ Emotional resonance
âœ“ Contemporary relevance

"Fractured Code" addresses all four through conscious choice in character development and world-building.

### Reddit Strategy

**Target Subreddits:**
- r/scifi (950k members)
- r/Cyberpunk (180k members)  
- r/books (19M members)
- r/booksuggestions (1.5M members)
- r/printSF (160k members)
- r/consciousness (45k members)
- r/singularity (220k members)

**Reddit Engagement Strategy:**

**r/scifi Post:**
**Title:** "I wrote a consciousness thriller about neural interface ethics - AMA about the research behind the fiction"

Hi r/scifi! I just released "Fractured Code," exploring what happens when neural enhancement becomes neural control.

The story follows a neural compliance specialist who discovers his job isn't optimizing consciousnessâ€”it's harvesting it.

I spent 2 years researching:
- Current brain-computer interface development
- Consciousness studies and philosophy of mind
- Historical resistance movements
- Neural plasticity and enhancement ethics

Happy to discuss the real science behind the fiction, or anything about writing hard sci-fi with authentic human stakes.

**r/Cyberpunk Post:**
**Title:** "New cyberpunk novel explores consciousness as the final frontier of corporate control"

Just dropped "Fractured Code"â€”cyberpunk that asks: What if your thoughts weren't your own?

Instead of external tech body mods, this story focuses on neural Links that optimize consciousness itself. The corporate dystopia is mental rather than physical.

Features:
âœ“ Street-level resistance perspective
âœ“ Female co-protagonist with evolutionary neural abilities
âœ“ Ancient AI network vs. parasitic corporate AI
âœ“ Hope within horror (transformation rather than destruction)

Anyone else tired of nihilistic cyberpunk? This has the genre's edge with genuine optimism.

**Engagement Guidelines:**
- Respond authentically to all comments
- Share relevant excerpts when asked
- Engage with other authors' posts
- Offer genuine value, not just promotion
- Build relationships before asking for support
